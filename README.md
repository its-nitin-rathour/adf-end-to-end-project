# 🚀 Azure Data Factory – The Backbone of Modern Data Integration  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** acts as the backbone for orchestrating and automating **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** workflows. It showcases how to seamlessly integrate multiple data sources, transform raw data into meaningful insights, and load it into target systems for analytics and reporting.  

ADF enables organizations to manage **big data pipelines**, ensuring data is reliable, scalable, and production-ready.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Automate **data ingestion** from diverse structured and unstructured sources.  
- Build scalable **ETL/ELT pipelines** using ADF.  
- Implement **data transformation** with Mapping Data Flows.  
- Enable **end-to-end data movement** across on-premises and cloud platforms.  
- Ensure **monitoring, alerts, and governance** for enterprise-level data workflows.  

---

## ⚙️ Key Features  
- **Pipeline Orchestration** → Design, schedule, and monitor pipelines.  
- **Linked Services & Datasets** → Seamless connectivity with SQL, Blob Storage, Data Lake, APIs, etc.  
- **Triggers** → Event-based and schedule-based data pipeline execution.  
- **Scalability** → Handles batch and streaming workloads.  
- **Integration Runtime (IR)** → Hybrid data movement across on-premises and cloud.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture  
1. **Source Systems**: On-premises databases, APIs, cloud storages.  
2. **Azure Data Factory**:  
   - Pipelines  
   - Data Flows  
   - Triggers  
   - Monitoring  
3. **Target Systems**: Azure Data Lake, SQL Data Warehouse, Synapse, Power BI for analytics.  

---

## 🔄 Workflow  
1. **Ingest** → Pull raw data from multiple sources.  
2. **Transform** → Clean, aggregate, and shape data using Mapping Data Flows.  
3. **Load** → Store transformed data into target systems.  
4. **Consume** → Expose insights via reporting tools (e.g., Power BI).  

---

## 📊 Use Cases  
- Enterprise **Data Warehousing**  
- **IoT Data Integration** pipelines  
- **Real-time Analytics** workflows  
- **Migration** from on-premises to Azure Cloud  

---

## 🚦 Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Configure **Linked Services** in ADF for your data sources.  
3. Import pipeline JSON files into your Data Factory.  
4. Deploy and trigger pipelines.  
5. Monitor execution in ADF Monitor panel.
